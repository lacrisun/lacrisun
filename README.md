Hello, my name Gusti Panji Widodo aka (@lacrisun)! ðŸ‘‹
I'm an aspiring software engineer, web developer, and game developer.
Iâ€™m still relatively new to many things and always eager to learn whenever possible. In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies and picking up new knowledge every day. When it comes to food, Iâ€™m pretty open-minded. Iâ€™ll eat almost anything as long as itâ€™s not overly sweet or salty.
My music taste is quite varied, but Iâ€™m particularly drawn to indie music, with an occasional touch of rock.
Right now, Iâ€™m working toward a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Informatics Engineering at the Universitas Riau.
At the moment, I have knowledge of many programming languages such as :
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- GDScript
- C#
- Lua
- Java

I also have knowledge of Linux/Unix systems and basic networking.
List of technologies I'm familiar with:
- MongoDB
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- discord.py
- discord.js
- Godot Engine
- Xendit
- Laravel
- Django
